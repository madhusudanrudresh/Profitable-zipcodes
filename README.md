Analysis based on Airbnb and Zillow dataset

I have used Python 3.7.1 and Tableau 2018.2. The following libraries are used for analysis in python:
1. Numpy - 1.15.4
2. Pandas - 0.23.4
3. Matplotlib - 3.0.2
4. Seaborn - 0.9.0

The path of the dataset needs to be given in line 2 of Data_Challenge.ipynb file to execute the code.
